## Technical Implementation Patterns

### Data Structure Patterns

**Content item schema**:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "content_type": "post|video|story|carousel",
  "platforms": ["instagram", "linkedin", "tiktok"],
  "status": "draft|scheduled|published|failed",
  "scheduled_time": "ISO8601",
  "published_time": "ISO8601",
  "author": "user_id",
  "assignee": "user_id",
  "approval_status": "pending|approved|rejected",
  "media": ["url1", "url2"],
  "caption": "text",
  "hashtags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "metrics": {
    "impressions": 0,
    "reach": 0,
    "engagement": 0,
    "clicks": 0
  },
  "platform_specific": {
    "instagram": {"post_id": "...", "permalink": "..."},
    "linkedin": {"post_id": "...", "permalink": "..."}
  }
}
```

**Monitoring event schema**:
```json
{
  "id": "event_id",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "platform": "instagram|twitter|linkedin|...",
  "event_type": "mention|comment|dm|share",
  "author": {
    "username": "...",
    "follower_count": 0,
    "verified": false
  },
  "content": "text",
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "emotion": "joy|anger|fear|...",
  "intent": "support|sales|advocacy|...",
  "keywords_matched": ["brand", "product"],
  "priority": "low|medium|high|urgent",
  "assigned_to": "user_id",
  "status": "unread|read|replied|archived"
}
```

### API Integration Patterns

**Polling vs webhooks**:
- Use webhooks where available (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Fall back to polling for platforms without webhook support
- Implement exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs
- Cache responses to minimize API calls

**Rate limiting strategies**:
- Per-platform rate limit tracking
- Request queuing with priority (real-time alerts > analytics)
- Distributed rate limit pools for multi-tenant systems
- Graceful degradation when limits hit

**Data freshness tiers**:
- Real-time: Mentions, DMs, comments (webhooks + 1-5min polling)
- Near real-time: Engagement metrics (15min polling)
- Hourly: Follower counts, reach/impressions
- Daily: Historical analytics, competitive benchmarks
